// TODO: Next page... redirect signed-in users to create their account if they haven't yet
//       Endpoints for authenticate token should probably also check if the user is finished with account
//       just in case, through token or DB. Then on frontend the AuthProtectedLayout can be used
//       to block access to anything with an account before account has been finished.
